Notes:

* The up-goer five challenge is *supposed* to be hard!
* Simple is good, but maybe this is *too* simple.
* This highlights for us where we might be able to use simpler, clearer language
* It also helps highlight where our jargon might actually be important if NOT using more complex words makes everything more clunky and awkward and harder to understand

* Think about learning music, math, or another language
* It can be very hard at the beginning


The Assignment:

Having deconstructed the description of our research into its most basic, awkward components, it’s time to build that description back up into a more coherent, simplified abstract that keeps the jargon that is necessary.
